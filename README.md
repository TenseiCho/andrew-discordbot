# Discord Bot Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for creating a Discord bot using JavaScript and the Discord.js library. It provides a basic structure and setup for building a bot with command handling and secure token management.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Discord bot token

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Discord bot token:
   ```
   BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual Discord bot token.

5. Customize the bot:
   - Open the `bot.js` file in your preferred code editor.
   - Modify the `PREFIX` variable to set your desired command prefix.
   - Add more commands and functionality as needed.

6. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   node bot.js
   ```

## Project Structure

- `bot.js`: The main bot file containing the bot setup, event listeners, and command handling.
- `.env`: The environment file to store sensitive information like the bot token (not included in the repository).
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, including the `.env` file and `node_modules` directory.
- `package.json`: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts.

## Dependencies

- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) - A powerful JavaScript library for interacting with the Discord API.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
